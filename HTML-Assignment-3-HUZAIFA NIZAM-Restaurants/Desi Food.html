    <dd>Thought to have developed in the royal kitchens of the 16th-19th century Mughal Empire, this rice dish is
      often served on special occasions.
      It can be made with lamb or beef but chicken biryani is a favorite.
      The meat and rice are cooked separately before being layered and cooked together with an assortment of spices.

    <dd>Warm and comforting, this dish may look simple enough but a combination of lentils, wheat, barley and minced
      beef (or other preferred meat) are slow-cooked for hours in gentle spices.
      The sticky consistency is achieved by constant stirring.

    <dd>Paya literally translates to trotters and this warming goat curry, with a soup-like consistency, is often
      eaten on cold winter mornings.
      Again, slow-cooking it will ensure that all the spices have infused into the perfectly tender meat.

    <dd>This Pakistani favorite, often served to guests on special occasions, consists of slow-cooked lamb shank --
      including the bone marrow.
      It used to be left to simmer and cook overnight to be served at sunrise.
      These days, most people cook it for a few hours but the longer the better.

    <dd>Bitter melon is thought to have a range of health benefits including purifying the blood, lowering blood sugar
      and boosting the immune system, which is why most Pakistanis have childhood memories of being persuaded to eat
      it by their parents despite its sour taste.
      In Pakistan, it's cooked with onions, red chili powder, turmeric, salt, coriander powder and a pinch of cumin
      seeds.

    <dd>Eggplant curry is so simple and quick to make.
      A masala base is created by frying onions, garlic and ginger, mixing in chilli powder, salt, turmeric and cumin
      seeds. Chopped eggplant is then added, potatoes too if wanted, and water before the concoction is left to cook
      for 15-20 minutes.
      Roasting the eggplant in the oven beforehand gives the dish a smoky flavor.

    <dd>A breakfast of champions, this combination of a poori (deep-fried bread), which is light and fluffy, is served
      with the rich tasting halwa (made with wheat semolina, sugar and butter) and channa (a chickpea curry).
      It's often consumed on Eid morning but can also be found as a street food breakfast or brunch option.

    <dd>This popular street food was once sold by cart-pushing vendors who would sing out their presence while hawking
      their wares. While the advent of more snack food restaurants has made this less common, the popularity of the
      gol gappa has not waned.
      The round shell is made with semolina and fried. Once it cools and becomes brittle, a hole is created and filled
      with a mixture of tamarind chutney, chilli, chaat masala, potato, onion and chickpeas. It is served with a bowl
      of spicy tamarind dip.

    <dd>Packed with protein and fiber, black eyed peas curry -- lobia daal -- is a particularly healthy option as well
      as a tasty one.
      Peas are soaked overnight for best results and the curry is made with a tomato base.
      It's best eaten with roti (flatbread), in which case the curry sauce should be kept a little thicker, or with
      rice.

    <dd>Equally as simple and a Pakistani favorite, this potato and cauliflower curry is from Punjab province.
      The trick is to make sure the potatoes and cauliflower florets cook at the right time.
      Cutting the latter to a slightly bigger size than the potatoes ensures the florets don't disintegrate before the
      potatoes are done
